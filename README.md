In this extend assignment 2 project, we added the feature of Porter Stemmer, Name Entity recognition, and conversation with another agent as the three major features. Porter Stemmer does the spelling check; Name Entity recognition does the specific name check, and conversation with another agent allows us to communicate with others if we connect the app online. Our app is doing the restaurant server job and hotel reception job, and users can input in a nicer interface with real time on it, and users can check the history and do both restaurant and hotel features in one device. 
Snipped pictures are provided in the PDF.

Lists of useful features that we can use in the future: 
1 Message class which contains three attributes of the message object which can help us define the message is from user or agent
2 Override adaptors to fit the chat window.
3 Create our own view holders, one for agent, and another one for user.
4 An xml layout named right chat and left chat can represent the message object.
5 the real time above the message.
added features here:
6 porter stemmer do the spelling check
7 name entity recognition does the specific name check
8 conversation with another agent allows to do the more communication and features.
